They conjure up images of a painful dental intervention. However, root canals are actually meant to save your tooth and prevent it from being extracted.</p> <p>When the pulp of a tooth (the soft interior part consisting of nerves, connective tissue and blood vessels) becomes infected and inflamed, an endodontist will perform a root canal, which is designed specifically to eliminate the infection in your root and to prevent it from getting reinfected. During the procedure the endodontist will remove the infected pulp from the tooth, clean it out, disinfect it and then refill and seal it. The procedure saves the tooth because a fully developed tooth doesn&rsquo;t need the interior pulp to survive. It can survive because the surrounding tissues continue to nourish it.</p> <p><strong>How does a root get infected?</strong></p> <p>Bacteria is the main cause of any tooth infection. Bacteria usually gets into a tooth from a crack, a chip or through deep decay. It can also be the result of trauma to the tooth.</p> <p>Today&rsquo;s root canals are done fairly quickly - and are nearly painless due to the number of sedation and/or pain killing options available. They are very effective, though in eliminating infections and saving teeth.</p> <p>The ultimate goal of a root canal is to save your natural tooth. Having a tooth in place is always best because:</p> <ul> <li>It prevents the other teeth from shifting and causing bite problems</li> <li>It prevents the other teeth from wearing and straining</li> <li>It prevents bone loss</li> <li>It preserves the natural appearance of your jawline and mouth</li> </ul> <p>Usually a root canal takes two visits - the first is to perform the root canal and the second is to remove the temporary filling and install the permanent crown.</p> <p>Root canals are usually successful however, as with any procedure there is the potential that your tooth won&rsquo;t heal as expected. Sometimes not all of the tiny, narrow, curved canals are treated and some of the infection remains. Other times, a delay in the placement of the final crown may cause bacteria to re-enter the canal. And occasionally a new problem is the culprit - bacteria introduced through a new crack in the tooth or crown or a filling. Should this happen then you might need either a retreatment or a root end treatment.&nbsp;</p>', 'Name': 'Root Canal', 'document_id': '1U4RRVruKpIdmSlji9ks'}
